Clothing is vital for humans in order to protect us from the elements, but it is also used to represent status and other aspects of our being. In many ways, it's interesting to see how some aspects of clothing have remained the same, and how they have advanced due to better technology, trade routes and fabrics. Let's examine some of the main eras of history to see how fashion has evolved.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling second-slide2"><div class="container rotate"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 center-block"><h3>Ancient Egyptian</h3><p>The desert environment of Ancient Egypt dictated that clothing had to be light in weight as well as color. Linen and cotton were especially favored for these qualities. Finer linens and silks were used very rarely for royalty or high priests. Men usually went topless, sporting a skirt-like loincloth fastened with a belt, or wore a long loose robe. Women were dressed in a large sheet of fabric that was draped over and around their bodies to form a long robe. Light leather or reed sandals were worn on the feet and well-off people decorated themselves with chunky, ornate metal jewelry.</p></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Egypt 1.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Ancient Egyptian King, Egyptian Commoners</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Egypt 2.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Egyptian Court Official, Egyptian King, Fanbearer</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Ancient Egypt.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Ancient Egyptian Soldiers, Egyptian King In Battle Attire, Charioteer</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling second-slide3"><div class="container rotate"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 center-block"><h3>Ancient Roman</h3><p>In Ancient Rome, tunics or togas were the norm for both genders. While men's tunics ended near the knees, women's often extended to the floor. The peplos for women looks similar, but was made from two separate pieces of cloth, attached with pins and a belt. Brides would wear a decorated tunic with a bright red veil. Married women wore a stola, which was another tunic worn over the first one, along with a palla or cloak. Upper classes used silks, and elaborate jewelry of precious metals to indicate their status and wealth. Unlike the Ancient Egyptians, who mostly stuck to natural colors, the Ancient Romans reveled in dying their fabrics deep hues that denoted status.</p></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Ancinet Rome 1.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Standard Bearer (German), Roman General</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Ancient Rome 3.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Noblewomen, Slave Girl</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Ancient Rome 4.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Roman Lictor, Emperor, Nobleman</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling second-slide4"><div class="container rotate"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 center-block"><h3>Medieval/Byzantine</h3><p>Byzantines favored fabrics with rich colors and patterns, especially silks if they could be afforded. Their clothing was loose and consisted of layered tunics and cloaks. Fashions that originated in Ancient Rome were still popular, such as the toga and stola. Women wore clothing that kept them mostly or fully covered, with veils or wrapped fabric to cover the hair. In Western Europe too, women's fashions tended to be quite layered, voluminous and long. In contrast, men could wear hose, along with a jacket. Rich people opted for fine linens or even silks, while lower classes wore cheaper wool.</p></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Eleventh Century Crusade.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Knights and Soldiers - First Crusade</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Byzantine Empire 4.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Deacon, Bishop, Levite - Church Official</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Sixth Century - Byzantine Empire.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Emperor Jusinian (482-565), Empress Theodora (d. 548)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling second-slide5"><div class="container rotate"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 center-block"><h3>Renaissance</h3><p>In Renaissance times, there were strict guidelines as to what people were allowed to wear. This largely depended on their status or profession. Working classes wore wool or rough linens, primarily because these fabrics were cheaper and easier to work in. For working men and women, clothing was simpler than the upper classes, so that it did not get in the way of their manual labor. Nobility and rich families favored richly dyed and printed fabrics. Women's gowns were tightly-laced at the bodice to show off a fine figure, with large skirts and sleeves. Men's clothing was also specially designed to accentuate their physical prowess. Depending on a person's status, or the occasion, such as a wedding or special feast, sleeve puffs and skirts were extended even further out for a larger impression.</p></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/First Third of the Sixteenth Century - Germany.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">German Citizens</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Late Sixteenth Century - Italy.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Venice (1583), Milan, Florence</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Sixteenth Century - France.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Francis II (1543-1560), Elizabeth - Daughter of Henry II - as a Bride (1545-1568), Francis II as Dauphin - Oldest Son of King</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling second-slide6"><div class="container rotate"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1 center-block"><h3>18th/19th Century</h3><p>Formality and decorum was key during the 18th and 19th centuries. Women were advised to wear conservative clothing to preserve their modesty. Often, the only part of their skin that showed was at the neckline and occasionally, the lower forearms. While tight corsets and large hoop skirts were originally popular, they later gave way to simpler, lighter dressers that accentuated the natural female figure. Men wore breeches or trousers, with starched shirts, and formal jackets. For many years, they would wear their shirt collars extended upwards, instead of folded down. Stylistic differences were sometimes borrowed from neighboring countries. At this time, hats were a favorite accessory and could be quite elaborate especially for well-off women.</p></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Second Half of the Eighteenth Century.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Lady in Hoop Dress</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/First Half of the Nineteenth Century - Germany.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">Upper-Class Dress (1820-1825)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="card-container col-lg-3 col-lg-offset-3 center-block"><div class="card"><div class="front"><div class="cover"><img src="images/cards/Late Nineteenth Century - Italian Folk Dress.JPG"></div></div><div class="back"><div class="content"><div class="main"><p class="text-center">San Germano, On the Roman Coast</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="vertical-scrolling third-section"><div class="horizontal-scrolling"><div class="container animated slideInLeft"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-10 center-block"><div class="center-block"><h3>Reflecting Historical Periods in Stage Costume</h3><div><p>Costume design is the envisioning of clothing and the overall appearance of a character or performer. Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character.[1] Costumes may be for a theater, cinema, or musical performance but may not be limited to such. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both create stage clothes.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="horizontal-scrolling third-slide2"><div class="curtainer"><div class="curtains open"><img src="images/curtain-left.min.jpg" class="curtainL"> <img src="images/curtain-right.min.jpg" class="curtainR"></div></div><div class="paper-dolls center-block"><img class="img-responsive male" src="images/costumes/male.png"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Costumes</button> <img class="img-responsive female" src="images/costumes/female.png"></div><div class="costumes"><img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/romeo.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/juliet.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/antony.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/cleo.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/petruchio.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/katharina.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/obeiron.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/titania.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/lear.png"> <img class="img-responsive draggable ui-draggable ui-draggable-handle" src="images/costumes/cordelia.png"></div></div></section></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/plugins.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
